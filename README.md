# Irina Ardeleanu - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About


With over 18 years of experience across multiple industries, I’ve developed a versatile skillset and am now transitioning to a career in data analytics. My background spans human resources, project management, and marketing, where I’ve built strong analytical abilities, problem-solving skills, and expertise in handling complex data.

As a Program Manager, I led a large-scale outreach campaign, gathering and analyzing data from various sources to identify target audiences, track performance, and optimize strategies. I also oversaw the accreditation process, monitored training program quality, and conducted surveys and focus groups, leveraging data-driven insights to improve operations.

Recently, I completed a Data Analytics course, deepening my skills in data management, statistical analysis, and data visualization tools. I’m proficient in working with complex datasets and transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. I’m excited to apply my analytical mindset and new expertise to solve real-world problems as I embark on this new career path.
